# hello-world
Created for CIT230
I’m excited about this class.  I just finished taking CIT 160, so that’s about the extent of my current programming skills.  The last time I programmed before that was in 2001.  Things have changed plenty since then.  I’ve done some HTML pages, but they are not professional.  I can usually make the code work, but I am horrible at making the page look good.  I’m currently trying to major in Computer Information Technology.  Ultimate goal is to get in to cyber security.  I live in Texas, and I am enjoying the nice weather before the heat arrives
